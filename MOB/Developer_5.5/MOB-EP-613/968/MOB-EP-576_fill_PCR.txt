#-------------Revision-History----------------
#Version 1.0 - run PCR Filling to Method B from MOB-EP-540. 
#            - added +3 Flux's over first reagent. 
#Version 2.0 - removed extra 3 fluxes on first and added 3 to second
#version 3.0 - removed extra fluxes and added 5 seocnds to both satuation times
#version 4.0 - reset satuation time and removed 2% from retract pressure. 
#Version 5.0 - reset retract pressure and removed 3 fluxes from first reagent. 
#Version 6.0 - added back 3 fluxes on first and removed 3 from second
#Version 7.0 - added back 3 fluxes to second reagent, removed 5s sat time form both spots
#version 8.0 - added 5s back onto sat times, added 2% to retract pressure. 
#version 9.0 - Method B +3 fluxes on second spot and -2% retraction pressure
