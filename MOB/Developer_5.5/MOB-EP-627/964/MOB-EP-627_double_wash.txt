#-------------Revision-History---------------
#version 1.0 - copied form MOB-D-029 V2.0 and then heavily modified. 
#            - split wash dispence into two sections. 
#                  first is 8 cycles of 36 steps at 50steps per second (highest torque)
#                  Back off wash actuator to releave pressure. 
#                  Dwell wash on CC for 10 seconds
#                  air purge for 30s forward from the eluate enable valve to clear capture column and protect open wash blister. wash should remain in behaind open protection valve. 
#                  re-enguage wash actuator
#                  Dispense rest of wash 6 cycles for 40 steps at 100s/s. 
#                  finish script as MOB-D-029 V2.0 - stepper down.
