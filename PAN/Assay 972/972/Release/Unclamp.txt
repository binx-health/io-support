#revision history
#1.0 20 Jan 2015   based on Unclamp.txt 3.6 to be distributed with PAN-D-050 and PAN-D-051 revision 4.0 PAN-CM-0214 
#2.0 08 Mar 2016   updated regvalve setting to work on EVS1 and EVS2 digital regulators. Was dpr dpr on 10 0, now regvalve 495 (direct setting)
#                  for release with PAN-D-050 and PAN-D-051 revision 5.0 PAN-CM-0411
#3.0 14 Mar 2017   Changed default power for stepper motors for this script only (85% instead of 70%). For release with PAN-D-050 and PAN-D-051 revision 5.4 PAN-CM-488
#4.0 03 Apr 2018   Set Pstat to internal circuit at end of assay - mitigation for charging electrode unnecessarily, PAN-CM-0493.
#5.0 11 Apr 2018   Change Mechanical valve steps to stop catching drawer PAN-CM-0493.
#6.0 17 Sep 2019   PAN-CM-0648
#                  removed buzzer from initial isolation valve drop
#                  added delay before isovalve check of 0.3 second
#                  added delay and isolation valve fireing after drawer has been ejected to stop user from closing drawer containing a cartridge.                  
#                  increased buzzer DC to 40%
