#revision history
#1.0 20 Jan 2015   first release for release with PAN-D-050 and PAN-D-051 rev 4.0 based on StartUp.txt v3.6 PAN-CM-0214
#2.0 13 Sep 2017   added preheat detection & PCR peltier step to preheat instrument to combat condensation. 
#3.0 11 Apr 2018   Change Mechanical valve steps to stop catching drawer PAN-CM-0493.
#4.0 17 Sep 2019   PAN-CM-648
#                  Removed PAN-D-0101 Referance
#                  Set stepper PWM to 100% for intial mtotor moves  
#                  Added half stroke retraction of wash and elution actuators
