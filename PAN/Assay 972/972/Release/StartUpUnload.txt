#revision history
#1.0  20 Jan 2015  first release for distribution with PAN-D-050 and PAN-D-051 revision 4.0 based on StartUpUnload 3.7 see PAN-CM-0231
#2.0  11 Apr 2018  Change Mechanical valve steps to stop catching drawer, change solenoid turn on point PAN-CM-0493.
#3.0  17 Sep 2019  PAN-CM-0648 
#                  Removed duplicated PWM 100 command
#                  Removed Mech valve L5 command after Clamp high torque as its not needed. 
#                  leave m1 solenoid on at start but test for isolation valve check after all actuators have reset
#                  added delay and isolation valve fireing after drawer has been ejected to stop user from closing drawer containing a cartridge.
#                  Increased Buzzer DC to 40%
#4.0     Nov 2019  PAN-CM-0661
#		           added vslow close/shut to overcome hard-to-release jams
#		           moved action of blisters to during clamping to increase likelihood of unjamming actuators
#			   turned on electromagnet prior to lifting the isolation valve.
