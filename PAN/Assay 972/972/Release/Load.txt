#revision history
#1.0  20 Jan 2015  based on Load.txt 2.4 for distribution with PAN-D-050 and PAN-D-051 revision 4.0 PAN-CM-0214
#2.0  08 Apr 2016  removed unnecessary pstat and psensor commands
#3.0  14 Mar 2017  Change to power supplied to stepper motors (85% instead of 70%) during script.For release with PAN-D-050 and PAN-D-051 revision 5.4 PAN-CM-488
#4.0  03 Apr 2018  Set Pstat to internal circuit at end of assay - mitigation for charging electrode unnecessarily, PAN-CM-0493.
#5.0  11 Apr 2018  Change Mechanical valve steps to stop catching drawer PAN-CM-0493.
#6.0  13 Aug 2019  PAN-CM-0648
#                  removed Clamp close to check Pstat commands
#                  turn isolation valve solenoid on after initial clamp move
#                  Test isolation valve after clamp moves to datum position
#                  removed PAN-D-102 reference as scripts now embodied in PAN-D-051
#                  increased second clamp stepper move from 500 to 550 steps
