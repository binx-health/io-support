#revision history
#1.0  08 Mar 2016  for distribution with PAN-D-050 and PAN-D-051 revision 5.0 PAN-CM-0399 processed on PAN-CM-0423
#2.0  09 Aug 2016  Amended clamp step to 1400 to fully close clamp for Pstat check, Processed on PAN-CM-0458
#3.0  14 Mar 2017  Change to power supplied to stepper motors (85% instead of 70%) during script.For release with PAN-D-050 and PAN-D-051 revision 5.4 PAN-CM-488
#4.0  13 Sep 2017  Added delay in before pstat checking to allow for clamp to fully engage with pins and resistance to settle. 
#                  added preheated step to control Peltier temps. allowed for 10C target offset for this script
#5.0  03 Apr 2018  Set Pstat 0 internal at start of assay to stop Electrode being 'live' when PCR Product is added, PAN-CM-0493. 
#6.0  11 Apr 2018  Change Mechanical valve steps to stop catching drawer PAN-CM-0493.
#7.0  17 Sep 2019  PAN-CM-0648
#                  removed drawer clamp command at start as we are now testing Pstat in air/clamp open position
#                  removed isolation valve solenoid on command to later inscript
#                  increased second clamp stepper move from 500 to 550 steps
#                  moved check isolation valve to after isolation valve is engaged and lifted by the clamp
#                  Removed PAN-D-108 reference
